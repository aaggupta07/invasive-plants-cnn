# Invasive Plant CNN



## Overview

In this project, I aimed to develop the most effective convolutional neural network to classify 23 different species of plants (as their species), as well as whether or not they are invasive. 69,850 images were used in total, with 70% used for training, 15% used for validation, and 15% used for testing. The model was mainly developed over four major design versions, and achieved a final testing accuracy of 88.2%, and was able to classify the plant as invasive or native 94.7% of the time.

## Invasive Plants
Invasive plants pose serious problems to the environment and economy
* Invasive plants are the leading cause of biodiversity loss, threaten food security, increase wildfire risk, cause desertification, damage infrastructure, and pose other major problems.
* Invasive plants are the worst offenders among invasive species, since they cause conditions that allow other invasive species to thrive, which can snowball into the destruction of an ecosystem.
* Invasive plants cost the United States an estimated $1.2B per year.

Unfortunately, it is hard to deal with invasive plants. The largest cause behind this is the lack of accurate reporting, which leads to slow responses. Neural network technology can prove a strong asset in this area, although it has not been largely explored. This project attempts to leverage the strengths of deep learning to help track invasive plants, thus alleviating many of the issues described above. <br>
